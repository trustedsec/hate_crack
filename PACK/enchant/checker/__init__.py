enchant.checker:  High-level spellchecking functionality
========================================================
    
This package is designed to host higher-level spellchecking functionality
than is available in the base enchant package.  It should make writing
applications that follow common usage idioms significantly easier.
    
The most useful class is SpellChecker, which implements a spellchecking
loop over a block of text.  It is capable of modifying the text in-place
if given an array of characters to work with.
    
This package also contains several interfaces to the SpellChecker class,
such as a wxPython GUI dialog and a command-line interface.

class SpellChecker:
    """Class implementing stateful spellchecking behaviour.
        
    This class is designed to implement a spell-checking loop over
    a block of text, correcting/ignoring/replacing words as required.
    This loop is implemented using an iterator paradigm so it can be
    embedded inside other loops of control.
    
    The SpellChecker object is stateful, and the appropriate methods
    must be called to alter its state and affect the progress of
    the spell checking session.  At any point during the checking
    session, the attribute 'word' will hold the current erroneously
    spelled word under consideration.  The action to take on this word
    is determined by calling methods such as 'replace', 'replace_always'
    and 'ignore_always'.  Once this is done, calling 'next' advances
    to the next misspelled word.
    
    As a quick (and rather silly) example, the following code replaces
    each misspelled word with the string "SPAM":
        
        >>> text = "This is sme text with a fw speling errors in it."
        >>> chkr = SpellChecker("en_US",text)
        >>> for err in chkr:
        ...   err.replace("SPAM")
        ...
        >>> chkr.get_text()
        'This is SPAM text with a SPAM SPAM errors in it.'
        >>>

    Internally, the SpellChecker always works with arrays of (possibly
    unicode) character elements.  This allows the in-place modification
    of the string as it is checked, and is the closest thing Python has
    to a mutable string.  The text can be set as any of a normal string,
    unicode string, character array or unicode character array. The
    'get_text' method will return the modified array object if an
    array is used, or a new string object if a string it used.
    
    Words input to the SpellChecker may be either plain strings or
    unicode objects.  They will be converted to the same type as the
    text being checked, using python's default encoding/decoding
    settings.
    
    If using an array of characters with this object and the
    array is modified outside of the spellchecking loop, use the
    'set_offset' method to reposition the internal loop pointer
    to make sure it doesn't skip any words.
