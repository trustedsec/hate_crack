enchant.tokenize:    String tokenization functions for PyEnchant
================================================================

An important task in spellchecking is breaking up large bodies of
text into their constituent words, each of which is then checked
for correctness.  This package provides Python functions to split
strings into words according to the rules of a particular language.
    
Each tokenization function accepts a string as its only positional
argument, and returns an iterator that yields tuples of the following
form, one for each word found::
        
    (<word>,<pos>)
        
The meanings of these fields should be clear: <word> is the word
that was found and <pos> is the position within the text at which
the word began (zero indexed, of course).  The function will work
on any string-like object that supports array-slicing; in particular
character-array objects from the 'array' module may be used.
    
The iterator also provides the attribute 'offset' which gives the current
position of the tokenizer inside the string being split, and the method
'set_offset' for manually adjusting this position.  This can be used for
example if the string's contents have changed during the tokenization
process.
    
To obtain an appropriate tokenization function for the language
identified by <tag>, use the function 'get_tokenizer(tag)'::
        
    tknzr = get_tokenizer("en_US")
    for (word,pos) in tknzr("text to be tokenized goes here")
        do_something(word)
    
This library is designed to be easily extendible by third-party
authors.  To register a tokenization function for the language
<tag>, implement it as the function 'tokenize' within the
module enchant.tokenize.<tag>.  The 'get_tokenizer' function
will automatically detect it.  Note that the underscore must be
used as the tag component separator in this case, in order to
form a valid python module name. (e.g. "en_US" rather than "en-US")
    
Currently, a tokenizer has only been implemented for the English
language.  Based on the author's limited experience, this should
be at least partially suitable for other languages.

This module also provides various implementations of "Chunkers" and
"Filters".  These classes are designed to make it easy to work with
text in a vareity of common formats, by detecting and excluding parts
of the text that don't need to be checked.

A Chunker is a class designed to break a body of text into large chunks
of checkable content; for example the HTMLChunker class extracts the 
text content from all HTML tags but excludes the tags themselves.
A Filter is a class designed to skip individual words during the checking
process; for example the URLFilter class skips over any words that
have the format of a URL.

For exmaple, to spellcheck an HTML document it is necessary to split the
text into chunks based on HTML tags, and to filter out common word forms
such as URLs and WikiWords.  This would look something like the following::

    tknzr = get_tokenier("en_US",(HTMLChunker,),(URLFilter,WikiWordFilter)))

    text = "<html><body>the url is http://example.com</body></html>"
    for (word,pos) in tknzer(text):
        ...check each word and react accordingly...
