## Installation
Get the latest hashcat binaries (https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)

```
git clone https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat.git
cd hashcat/
make
make install
```

### External Dependencies
These are required for certain download/extraction flows:

- `7z`/`7za` (p7zip) — used to extract `.7z` archives.
- `transmission-cli` — used to download Weakpass torrents.

Install commands:

Ubuntu/Kali:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y p7zip-full transmission-cli
```

macOS (Homebrew):
```
brew install p7zip transmission-cli
```

### Download hate_crack
```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/trustedsec/hate_crack.git```
* Customize binary and wordlist paths in "config.json"

* The hashcat-utils repo is a submodule. If you didnt clone with --recurse-submodules then initialize with

```cd hate_crack;git submodule update --init --recursive```

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Project Structure
Core logic is now split into modules under `hate_crack/`:

- `hate_crack/cli.py`: argparse helpers and config overrides.
- `hate_crack/api.py`: Hashview, Weakpass, and Hashmob integrations (downloads/menus/helpers).
- `hate_crack/attacks.py`: menu attack handlers.
- `hate_crack/hashmob_wordlist.py`: Hashmob wordlist utilities (thin wrapper; calls into api.py).
- `hate_crack/main.py`: main CLI implementation.

The top-level `hate_crack.py` remains the main entry point and orchestrates these modules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## References and Thanks

This project depends on and is inspired by a number of external projects and services. Thanks to:

- Hashview (http://github.com/hashview/)
- Weakpass (https://weakpass.com)
- Hashmob (https://hashmob.net)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Usage
You can run hate_crack as a tool, as a script, or via `uv run`:

```
uv run hate_crack.py
or 
uv run hate_crack.py <hash_file> <hash_type> [options]
```

### Run as a tool (recommended)
Install once from the repo root:

```
uv tool install .
hate_crack
```

If you run the tool outside the repo, set `HATE_CRACK_HOME` so assets like
`hashcat-utils` can be found:

```
HATE_CRACK_HOME=/path/to/hate_crack hate_crack
```

### Run as a script
The script uses a `uv` shebang. Make it executable and run:

```
chmod +x hate_crack.py
./hate_crack.py
```

You can also use Python directly:

```
python hate_crack.py
```

### Makefile helpers
Build hashcat-utils and install the tool:

```
make install
```

Build only hashcat-utils:

```
make
```

Clean build/test artifacts:

```
make clean
```

Run the test suite:

```
make test
```

Common options:
- `--download-hashview`: Download hashes from Hashview before cracking.
- `--weakpass`: Download wordlists from Weakpass.
- `--hashmob`: Download wordlists from Hashmob.net.
- `--download-torrent <FILENAME>`: Download a specific Weakpass torrent file.
- `--download-all-torrents`: Download all available Weakpass torrents from cache.
- `--wordlists-dir <PATH>` / `--optimized-wordlists-dir <PATH>`: Override wordlist directories.
- `--pipal-path <PATH>`: Override pipal path.
- `--maxruntime <SECONDS>`: Override max runtime.
- `--bandrel-basewords <PATH>`: Override bandrel basewords file.
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging (writes `hate_crack.log` in repo root).

The <hash_type> is attained by running `hashcat --help`

Example Hashes: http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes


```
$ hashcat --help |grep -i ntlm
   5500 | NetNTLMv1                                        | Network protocols
   5500 | NetNTLMv1 + ESS                                  | Network protocols
   5600 | NetNTLMv2                                        | Network protocols
   1000 | NTLM                                             | Operating-Systems
```

```
$ ./hate_crack.py <hash file> 1000

                          Version 2.0
  

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage for the Hashview integration.

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest -v

# Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_hashview.py -v
```

You can also run the full suite with `make test`.

### Live Hashview Tests

The live Hashview upload test is skipped by default. To run it, set the
environment variable and provide valid credentials in `config.json`:

```bash
HATE_CRACK_RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/test_upload_cracked_hashes.py -v
```

### End-to-End Install Tests (Local + Docker)

Local uv tool install + script execution (uses a temporary HOME):

```bash
HATE_CRACK_RUN_E2E=1 uv run pytest tests/test_e2e_local_install.py -v
```

Docker-based end-to-end install/run (cached via `Dockerfile.test`):

```bash
HATE_CRACK_RUN_DOCKER_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/test_docker_script_install.py -v
```

The Docker E2E test also downloads a small subset of rockyou and runs a basic
hashcat crack to validate external tool integration.

### Test Structure

- **tests/test_hashview.py**: Comprehensive test suite for HashviewAPI class with mocked API responses, including:
  - Customer listing and data validation
  - Authentication and authorization tests
  - Hashfile upload functionality
  - Complete job creation workflow

All tests use mocked API calls, so they can run without connectivity to a Hashview server. This allows tests to run in CI/CD environments (like GitHub Actions) without requiring actual API credentials.

### Continuous Integration

Tests automatically run on GitHub Actions for every push and pull request (Ubuntu, Python 3.13).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Quick Crack
* Runs a dictionary attack using all wordlists configured in your "hcatOptimizedWordlists" path
and optionally applies a rule that can be selected from a list by ID number. Multiple rules can be selected by using a
comma separated list, and chains can be created by using the '+' symbol.

```
Which rule(s) would you like to run?
(1) best64.rule
(2) d3ad0ne.rule
(3) T0XlC.rule
(4) dive.rule
(99) YOLO...run all of the rules
Enter Comma separated list of rules you would like to run. To run rules chained use the + symbol.
For example 1+1 will run best64.rule chained twice and 1,2 would run best64.rule and then d3ad0ne.rule sequentially.
Choose wisely: 
```
 



#### Extensive Pure_Hate Methodology Crack
Runs several attack methods provided by Martin Bos (formerly known as pure_hate)
  * Brute Force Attack (7 characters)

    * All wordlists in "hcatOptimizedWordlists" with "best64.rule"
    * wordlists/rockyou.txt with "d3ad0ne.rule"
    * wordlists/rockyou.txt with "T0XlC.rule"
  * Top Mask Attack (Target Time = 4 Hours)
  * Fingerprint Attack
  * Combinator Attack
  * Hybrid Attack
  * Extra - Just For Good Measure
    - Runs a dictionary attack using wordlists/rockyou.txt with chained "combinator.rule" and "InsidePro-PasswordsPro.rule" rules
    
#### Brute Force Attack
Brute forces all characters with the choice of a minimum and maximum password length.

#### Top Mask Attack
Uses StatsGen and MaskGen from PACK (https://thesprawl.org/projects/pack/) to perform a top mask attack using passwords already cracked for the current session.
Presents the user a choice of target cracking time to spend (default 4 hours).

#### Fingerprint Attack
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=fingerprint_attack

Runs a fingerprint attack using passwords already cracked for the current session.

#### Combinator Attack
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=combinator_attack

Runs a combinator attack using the "rockyou.txt" wordlist.

#### Hybrid Attack
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hybrid_attack

* Runs several hybrid attacks using the "rockyou.txt" wordlists.
  - Hybrid Wordlist + Mask - ?s?d wordlists/rockyou.txt ?1?1
  - Hybrid Wordlist + Mask - ?s?d wordlists/rockyou.txt ?1?1?1
  - Hybrid Wordlist + Mask - ?s?d wordlists/rockyou.txt ?1?1?1?1
  - Hybrid Mask + Wordlist - ?s?d ?1?1 wordlists/rockyou.txt
  - Hybrid Mask + Wordlist - ?s?d ?1?1?1 wordlists/rockyou.txt
  - Hybrid Mask + Wordlist - ?s?d ?1?1?1?1 wordlists/rockyou.txt

#### Pathwell Top 100 Mask Brute Force Crack

optimized wordlists for the left and right sides.

#### Middle Combinator Attack
https://jeffh.net/2018/04/26/combinator_methods/

Runs a modified combinator attack adding a middle character mask:
wordlists/rockyou.txt + masks + worklists/rockyou.txt

Where the masks are some of the most commonly used separator characters:
2 4 <space> - _ , + . &

#### Thorough Combinator Attack
https://jeffh.net/2018/04/26/combinator_methods/
